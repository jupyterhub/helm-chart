  # Official status -> ignore pebble:
  #
  #   In order to get official status on artifacthub.io, we must currently only
  #   let the repo contain Helm charts of software we have created. Due to this,
  #   pebble is not published to artifacthub.io.
  #
  #   For official status, we must also make sure to publish the README.md file
  #   along with the packaged helm chart, this means to include a README.md file
  #   next to values.yaml when we package it with chartpress.
  #
  # Ignoring pre-releases and dev-releases:
  #
  #   We can ignore the pre-releases and dev-releases by passing `version: "-"`,
  #   but it is very tricky using the RE2 kind of regexp without negative
  #   lookaheads to only filter out the dev-releases.
