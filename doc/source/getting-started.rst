.. _getting-started:

Getting started with JupyterHub
===============================

The goal of **JupyterHub** is to create custom computing environments that
can be accessed remotely (e.g., at a specific URL) by multiple users.

This guide acts as an assistant to guide you through the process of setting
up your JupyterHub deployment. It helps you connect and configure the
following things:

* A **cloud provider** such Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, and
  others
* **Kubernetes** to manage resources on the cloud
* **Helm** to configure and control Kubernetes
* **Docker** to use containers that standardize computing environments
* **JupyterHub** to manage users and deploy Jupyter notebooks

You already are well on your way to understanding what it means (procedurally)
to deploy Jupyterhub. 

Deployment Guide
----------------

We've put together a short walkthrough going from having nothing set up to a
complete deployment of jupyterhub on Google Cloud. If you want to follow that
comprehensive walkthrough, the next step on your journey is to :ref:`create a
Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud <google-cloud>`. 


Extending and Customizing JupyterHub
------------------------------------

If you'd like to know how to expand and customize your jupyterhub setup, such
as increasing the computational resources available to users or changing authentication
services, check out :ref:`extending-jupyterhub`.

Dependencies for Deploying a JupyterHub Instance
------------------------------------------------

For a more extensive description of the tools and services that JupyterHub
depends upon, see our :ref:`tools` page.
